# Final_Project_JEM207_Zeman_Carvas
Real Estate Market Analysis



Our project focuses on identifying undervalued apartments in Prague by analyzing advertisements from sreality.cz. Users can independently evaluate rental and purchase prices using predictions generated by our OLS model.


### The following navigation scheme provides a clear idea of ​​what paths the user can take:
<pre>
        ├── main_model.py
        │   ├── check_history (check when the model was last updated)
        │   │   ├── sale
        │   │   └── rent
        │   │ 
        │   └── update_model (scrape fresh data, process them and update the OLS model)
        │       ├── sale
        │       └── rent
        │      
        └── main_search.py (if you decide the model is relevant, you can start looking for undervalued apartments)
                ├── sale  ── after scraping the user is redirected to the website with built-in filter (<a href="https://vojtechzeman.github.io/Final_Project_JEM207_Zeman_Carvas/" title=https://vojtechzeman.github.io/Final_Project_JEM207_Zeman_Carvas/>Github pages</a>)
                └── rent  ──              ────────── // ──────────
</pre>

Users can enhance the model’s robustness by updating it through main_model.py, which expands the training dataset with each update. For modeling we use "deleted" advertisements - those that have disappeared from the website since the last scraping. We assume that deleted advertisements were listed at market price and were successfully sold. To help users track timing and know when the model was last updated, we implemented a "history_checker" in "main_model.py" that clearly displays the number of deleted items, which corresponds to model updates.

The scraper updates prices of previously downloaded advertisements and downloads only new data that is missing to make the process faster and more efficient. (rent_0.csv and sale_0.csv contain data scraped between October and January by a different scraper; we use this until we accumulate enough data in rent.csv and sale.csv with the current scraper).

After successfully building the model, users can search for undervalued apartments using "main_search.py". The program allows users to analyze either sales or rental listings by scraping current advertisements. Results are displayed on an interactive website where users can apply filters to find their ideal apartment. Each property listing includes an image that links directly to the original advertisement.

If users want to monitor listings without downloading the repository, they can use the <a href="https://vojtechzeman.github.io/Final_Project_JEM207_Zeman_Carvas/" title=https://vojtechzeman.github.io/Final_Project_JEM207_Zeman_Carvas/>link</a> for Github Pages (though the data will not be up-to-date).

For future improvements to the project, we plan to implement a continuous variable measuring the size of spaces associated with apartments (balcony, garden, cellar, etc.), which we could not scrape with the previous scraper and did not have time to implement with the new scraper.
